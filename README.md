## **DevOps My App Project**

A simple Node.js API integrated with **Docker**, **Docker Compose**, **MongoDB**, and automated CI/CD using **Jenkins**, designed to practice and demonstrate DevOps pipelines.

---

## **Project Objectives**

âœ… Build a full CI/CD pipeline from scratch  
âœ… Containerise the application with Docker  
âœ… Automate deployment using Jenkins pipelines  
âœ… Integrate automated testing with Jest  
âœ… Deploy with Docker Compose

---

## **Tech Stack**

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas / Docker MongoDB
- **DevOps:** Docker, Docker Compose, Jenkins
- **Testing:** Jest, Supertest

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Local Development**

# Clone repository

git clone https://github.com/nour0205/devops_my_app.git
cd devops_my_app

# Install dependencies

npm install

# Run the app

node index.js
The app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

2. Run Tests
   bash
   Copier
   Modifier
   npm test
   Tests are located in the **tests** folder and include:

Basic sanity tests

API endpoint integration tests

3. Docker Build & Run
   bash
   Copier
   Modifier

# Build Docker image

docker build -t nour0205/my_app:1.0 .

# Run container

docker run -d -p 5001:3000 --name my_app nour0205/my_app:1.0

4. Docker Compose
   To start the app and MongoDB as services:
   docker-compose up -d --build
   To stop:
   docker-compose down

CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)
Stages:

Clone repository

Run tests with Jest

Build Docker image

Push image to Docker Hub

Deploy using Docker Compose

ğŸ”— Jenkinsfile is included at project root.
